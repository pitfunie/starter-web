New Delhi: The government today reacted sharply to opposition criticism of its decision to convert excess rice in central godowns into ethanol to make hand sanitisers and to add to petrol to reduce emissions, which was reported by NDTV on Monday. The move is seen as controversial with millions on the brink of starvation since the country went into lockdown last month to fight the rapid spread of coronavirus. 
 After all when will India poor wake up? You are dying of hunger and they are busy cleaning the hands of the rich by making sanitisers from your portion of rice
